# API-project
University project for the logical managmente of a social network with C.<br>
The possible operations are
<ul>
  <li>create a new user</li>
  <li>delete a user</li>
  <li>create a relationship (not symmetrical) between users</li>
<li>report (where it is shown, for every relationship, the user with the most follower for that relationship)</li>
</ul>
The focus of the project is to use the the least memory possible and to have the information processed quickly so it is almost completely based on hash tables.
