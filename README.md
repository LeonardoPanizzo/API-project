# API-project
University project for the logical managmente of a social network with C.
The possible operation are
-create a new user
-delete a user
-create a relationship (not symmetrical) between users
-report (where it is shown, for every relationship, the user with the most follower for that relationship)

The focus of the project is to use the the least memory possible and to have the information processed quickly so it is almost completely based on hash tables.
